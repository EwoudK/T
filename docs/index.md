The current simulation consists of four actors (England, France, Spain, Prussia).
England takes the roll of the pariah with negative propensities (-1) connecting it to the other actors.
The other actors all have positive propensities (+1) with one another and a negative one (-1) with England.


### Note on the visualisations
The visualisation of the system consists of four coloured squares which represent England, France, Spain and Prussia (in that order).
Blue equals a spin of -1 while Red equals a spin of +1.
