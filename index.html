<p>There are three visualisations for now. Evolution.html, PathIntegral.html, Tree.html.
Evolution shows the evolution of the system from one configuration into a new one because of actors seeking to maximize their gain.
Tree shows the rationality tree that is built for every actor in a certain step. The tree is built as follows:
- actor for whom the tree is built can choose to stay in current configuration or flip its spin.
- all the other actors flip their spin.
- the configuration where the all other actors do not flip their spin is added as well.
This gives 2*[(N-1) + 1] new configurations per rationality tree node.
Red is for -1, Blue is for +1.
The gain is calculated with the hamiltonian and propensities that can be found inside the file System.py
For the propensities a symmetric matrix is built with the diagonal elements zero (no self interactions).</p>
<p>Tree is able to show the rationality tree for every country for every step in the simulation by use of the selection menu.</p>
<p>PathIntegral shows the decision process every actor makes to decide which path to take.
Every actor wants to end in a configuration that maximizes its personal gain but also maximize its path to this configuration.</p>
<p>One caveat, the current code does not detect unstable systems and will loop forever.
This is not a hard fix but still needs to be implemented either way.</p>
