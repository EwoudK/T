# Thesis: Coalition theory

There are three visualisations for now. Evolution.html, PathIntegral.html, Tree.html.
    - Evolution shows the evolution of the system from one configuration into a new one because of actors seeking to maximize their gain.
    - Tree shows the rationality tree that is built for every actor in a certain step. Tree is able to show the rationality tree for every country for every step in the simulation by use of the selection menu. The tree is built as follows:
        - actor for whom the tree is built can choose to stay in current configuration or flip its spin.
        - all the other actors flip their spin.
        - the configuration where the all other actors do not flip their spin is added as well.
    
   - PathIntegral shows the decision process every actor makes to decide which path to take. Every actor wants to end in a configuration that maximizes its personal gain but also maximize its path to this configuration.
