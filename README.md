# Thesis: Coalition theory

There are three visualisations for now. Evolution.html, PathIntegral.html, Tree.html:

   - Evolution shows the evolution of the system from one configuration into a new one because of actors seeking to maximize their gain.
    
   - PathIntegral shows the decision process every actor makes to decide which path to take. Every actor wants to end in a configuration that maximizes its personal gain but also maximize its path to this configuration.
